##  Overview

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of manifold learning techniques and dimensionality reduction on the *Yeast* dataset (in `.arff` format).  

The goal is to explore and visualize how high-dimensional data can be embedded in lower-dimensional spaces (2D/3D) while preserving important structure, and to analyze the effects these embeddings have on classification performance.

Key tasks include:

- Preprocessing the Yeast dataset (train & test splits in ARFF format)  
- Applying PCA, t-SNE, and Isomap  
- Visualizing the embeddings  
- Evaluating classification accuracy (e.g. via nearest neighbor or other classifiers)  
- Performing statistical / correlation analysis on features  
- Documenting observations and insights in the PDF

##  Key Concepts

- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):** Focuses on preserving *local* structure of data  
- **Isomap:** Preserves *global* geometric relationships via geodesic distances  
- **PCA:** Used for baseline dimensionality reduction  
- **Veracity Analysis:** Detects noisy labels, outliers & ambiguous samples through manifold topology inspection  

---

##  Technical Highlights

- **Data Loading:** Yeast dataset parsed from `.arff` using `scipy.io.arff`  
- **Feature Scaling:** Standardized using `StandardScaler`  
- **Feature Analysis:** Skewness, kurtosis, correlation, and intrinsic dimensionality estimation  
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for t-SNE (perplexity, learning rate, init)  
- **Visualization:** Cluster-based scatter plots using `matplotlib`  
- **Data Veracity Inspection:**  
  - Centroid proximity for noisy labels  
  - k-NN distance-based outlier detection  
  - Neighborhood entropy for hard-to-learn samples

##  Key Results

| Category | Samples | % of Total | Observation |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Multi-label Genes | 2385 | 98.7% | Highly pleiotropic structure |
| Noisy / Ambiguous Samples | 824 | 34.1% | Overlapping functional roles |
| Outliers | 101 | 4.2% | Possible artifacts / rare states |
| Hard-to-Learn Samples | 84 | 3.5% | Boundary ambiguity in clusters |

**Optimal t-SNE Parameters:**  
`Perplexity = 5`, `Learning Rate = 200`, `Init = PCA`  
**Final KL Divergence:** `2.023`

 ## Visual Insights

t-SNE and Isomap visualizations reveal dense manifold structures with overlapping clusters of gene functions.
Multi-label regions appear highly entangled, confirming biological interdependence among functional categories.

(You can add PNG screenshots of your t-SNE / Isomap plots here)

## Observations & Insights

Gene expression data exhibits high manifold complexity

Non-linear methods (t-SNE, Isomap) outperform PCA in cluster separability

Noise and overlap are intrinsic to multi-functional gene data

Classifier performance is expected to degrade in regions of high neighborhood entropy

## Future Work

Incorporate UMAP for better scalability and local-global balance

Extend to interactive dashboards using Plotly or Bokeh

Combine manifold learning with explainable AI for interpretability

Explore biological correlations between cluster proximity and gene ontology
